# Grandma vs. CookieMonster

This project originally began as a three-liner in a presentation.

In the following discussion, several aspects of *functional* and *object-oriented* programming were talked about.

In the end, several knights followed **King Arthur's** call to defeat the CookieMonster and keep all the cookies safe.
